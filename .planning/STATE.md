# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** Compose a speech from curators' points, resolve conflicts explainably, and build a bootable unattended installer — zero cost, no central service in the critical path.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Omarchy Research & Arch-Variant Study

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 5 (Omarchy Research & Arch-Variant Study) — 6 phases total, numbered 0–5 per ADR
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-12 — Project initialized from doc ingest (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md created)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All D1–D20 + D13a + 7 invariants are LOCKED (docs/09 via PROJECT.md `<decisions>` block). Do not re-open. Highlights for current work:

- D17/D20: Phase 0 gates everything — no schema drafting before the six `research/` deliverables exist
- D19: TDD everywhere — every phase plan specifies test scenarios before implementation tasks; resolver near-total coverage; determinism + WASM/native parity are automated tests
- Process: fully autonomous run to v1.0; no pausing between phases except true blockers; record new fork decisions and continue
- Roadmapper: phases numbered 0–5 to match ADR/SPEC naming exactly; Omarchy-on-variant retarget is a non-gating Phase 2 stretch criterion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0 requires cloning and analyzing `https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy` (network access needed; analyze source, not summaries)
- Phases 2–4 require privileged ISO builds (mkarchiso, live-build, loop devices, Docker) — expected available on this host per docs/00; not a blocker, noted for planning

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Post-v1.0 | Phase 6 hardware-scanning installer; Fedora translator; direct-to-disk; GitLab parity; post-install reconciliation | Locked deferral (D2) | Project init |
